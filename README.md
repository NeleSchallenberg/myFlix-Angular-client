# MyFlixAngularClient

This project is a web application about women in the film industry.
It was built as a task for Achievement 6 in [CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer) and uses the RESTful [Movie API](https://github.com/NeleSchallenberg/movie-api) from Achievement 2.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.

## About

The achievement objective is to build a client-side component with Angular and to learn how to work with others by writing and sharing documentation, providing feedback, and making a contribution to the tech community.

## Web View

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

## User Flow

additional movie details will be displayed. The single movie view will contain the following additional features:
  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the ​director view,​ where details about the director of that particular movie will be displayed.
  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the ​genre view,​ where details about that particular genre of the movie will be displayed.

- The application must be written in Angular (version 9 or later)
- The application requires the latest version of Node.js and npm package
- The application must contain user registration and login forms
- The application must be designed using Angular Material
- The application's codebase must contain comments using Typedoc
- The project must contain technical documentation using JSDoc
- The project must be hosted on GitHub Pages
